# Welcome to Auto_Restwert_Rechner.

## Current information
Unfortunately, this project is suspended until an indefinite time. The application works, but features are missing.

As soon as this project is continued, so was my idea, the following features should still be included:

- Database with car values
- Other items than just cars, such as electronic equipment.
- In addition to the calculation, possibly comparison with marketplaces (market value check.)
- Change programming language to C#
- Change name of the project

## Vision
This should be a project that can calculate the value of the car. This is especially to support those who are not so knowledgeable about cars.
